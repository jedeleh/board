>---==> What indexes?
I'm optimizing for lookup because reading is far more frequent than commenting.
  1. fast lookup for showing the board--reading is more frequent than posting

    posts.created_at

    CREATE INDEX idx_created_at ON posts (created_at);

  2. do we want one to optimize the lookup of comments for post? reasoning: as
    is, there's no need to lookup all comments in the system.

    posts.comments.created_at, posts.comments.post_id

    CREATE INDEX idx_created_at_post_id ON comments (created_at, post_id);

  Comments are only attached to messages, not other comments. Things get super
  fun if we have nested threads.

  comments and posts are ordered by created_at, descending order

TODO:

  √ Setup Github
  √ Setup postgres
  √ Setup devise

  Setup rspec
  Per Chris S. I focus on the backend aspects of the application.

  MAYBE: Figure out how to load it up to Heroku
  
Ordering:
  User
    √ bin/rails generate model user name:string email:string
    √ bin/rails generate devise User
    -----
  Post
    √ bin/rails generate scaffold post user:references title:string body:string
  Comment
    √ bin/rails generate model comment post:references user:references body:string
    √ bin/rails generate controller Comments create update show
    
After

Project Requirements
r √ Upload finished project to GitHub
  √ Use latest version of Rails 5 or greater: using rails 7
  √ Use Postgres for the database
  √ Use Ruby 2.6 or newer (we use 2.6.9 on our main project): using Ruby 3
  Use Rspec to add tests that cover critical behavior
  What to test & how to test is up to you

Bonus features (not required, but nice to have)
  Style using Bootstrap, Tailwinds, or a CSS library of your choice
  Add a modal for logging in
  Add a modal for creating a new post
  Paginate posts#index and/or posts#show (comments)
  Deploy project to Heroku (make an account for free)

    - test validation
  Comments
    - test sorting
    - test validation
    - test only getting the comments for a message.
